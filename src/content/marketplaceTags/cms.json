    "description": "A CMS is a software system that allows users to create, manage, and publish content on a website. It's particularly useful for websites that require a lot of content, such as blogs, news sites, and e-commerce sites. CMSs offer several advantages over traditional website development, including better scalability, flexibility, and performance. Additionally, CMSs are well-suited for applications that require high availability, horizontal scalability, and flexible data models."
