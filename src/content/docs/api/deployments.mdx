## Use GitHub Action

You can use our GitHub action to launch deployments of your services.

```yml
- uses: ptah-sh/deploy-action

```

## Use Raw HTTP API

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X POST \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -H 'Accept: application/json' \
            -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.PTAH_API_TOKEN }}' \
            -d '{"processes":[{"name":"svc","dockerImage":"ghcr.io/ptah-sh/ptah-server:latest"}]}' \
            https://ctl.ptah.sh/api/v0/services/${serviceId}/deploy
```
