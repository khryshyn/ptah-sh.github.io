## Create a new Node

First, we need to create a node on the ptah.sh platform.

1) Navigate to the [Nodes page](https://ctl.ptah.sh/nodes).
2) Click "Create" on the top right of the page.
3) Enter the name of the Node. It can be anything you want. We prefer to name nodes after the server provider regions (e.g. `us-east-1`).
4) Click "Create".

This will create a record in our database, but you can not yet make any changes to your infrastructure.

## Install an Agent

1) Navigate to the created node (find it the [Nodes page](https://ctl.ptah.sh/nodes)).
2) Locate the "Agent Status" section.
3) Click "Copy" on the block with the setup script.
4) Open a `root` SSH connection to your VPS (or bare-metal server).
5) Paste and execute the CLI script. The script will:
  - install the required dependencies (Docker and it's utilities)
  - create a system user `ptah`
  - download a latest version of an agent software from GitHub releases
  - add `ptah-agent` to the `systemd` startup scripts
  - start the agent
6) Navigate back to the node and refresh the page.
7) You should see the agent version and other meta-information if the process succeeded.
