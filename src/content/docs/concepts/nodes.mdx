Nodes are functional units of the Ptah.sh platform. They are the physical or virtual servers that host the services.

## Swarm Clusters

Nodes are managed by the Docker Swarm. Each node should be part of a Swarm cluster. By default, all nodes are part of the same Swarm cluster.

Each node may be either managers or workers. The Docker Swarm cluster is responsible for managing the nodes and their services.
